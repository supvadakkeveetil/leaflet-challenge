# leaflet-challenge
## Project Description:
The United States Geological Survey(USGS) provides scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change.
They are interested in building a new set of tools which will allow visualization of the earthquake data.
In this challenge, we are developing a way to visualize USGS Earthquake data which will educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.
#### Dataset
Data on Earthquakes in GeoJson format can be found on 
[
](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)

### Visualization

Visualization of Earthquakes that occured during the last 7 days 
- Map is created using Leaflets
- The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and the depth of the earthquake by color. 
- The legend gives information on the depth on a Color scale
